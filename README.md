# The-Eigenvalue-Problem

The eigenvalue problem is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and is used to find the special numbers and vectors that characterize a linear transformation. Given a square matrix A, the eigenvalue problem is to find the non-zero vectors x and scalar λ that satisfy the equation:

Ax = λx

Here, x is the eigenvector and λ is the eigenvalue associated with that eigenvector. The equation states that when the linear transformation represented by A is applied to the vector x, the result is a scalar multiple of x. In other words, the eigenvector x is transformed only by scaling, with the scaling factor given by the eigenvalue λ.

# Solving the Eigenvalue problem
Solving the eigenvalue problem involves finding the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the matrix A. These values play a crucial role in various applications, including in physics, engineering, and computer science. They are used to study the behavior of systems, to identify important patterns, and to analyze data, among other things.

The steps involved in solving the eigenvalue problem are:

2. Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial, which correspond to the eigenvalues of A.
3. For each eigenvalue λ, solve the equation (A - λI)x = 0 to find the corresponding eigenvectors x.
4. Normalize each eigenvector to ensure that its length is 1.
5. Collect the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs.
6. Return the pairs as the solution to the eigenvalue problem.

# Example in python

In this script, we first define a 2x2 square matrix A using NumPy's array function. We then use NumPy's linalg.eig function to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The eig function returns two arrays: eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenvalues array contains the eigenvalues of A, and the eigenvectors array contains the corresponding eigenvectors, stored as columns of the array.

We then print the eigenvalues and eigenvectors to the console.

To verify that the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs are indeed valid, we loop through each eigenvalue-eigenvector pair and check whether the equation Ax
```
import numpy as np

# Define the square matrix A
A = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 1]])

# Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

# Print the eigenvalues and eigenvectors
print("Eigenvalues:", eigenvalues)
print("Eigenvectors:", eigenvectors)

# Verify that Ax = λx for each eigenvalue-eigenvector pair
for i in range(len(eigenvalues)):
    lambda_i = eigenvalues[i]
    x_i = eigenvectors[:, i]
    ax_i = np.dot(A, x_i)
    lmbd_x_i = lambda_i * x_i
    print("λ_{} x_{}: ".format(i+1, i+1), lmbd_x_i)
    print("Ax_{}: ".format(i+1), ax_i)
    print("Are they equal? ", np.allclose(lmbd_x_i, ax_i))
```

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental concepts in linear algebra that are used in various mathematical and scientific applications, including physics, computer graphics, and machine learning. They are associated with square matrices.

**Eigenvalues:**
Eigenvalues are scalars (numbers) that represent how a linear transformation (represented by a square matrix) scales or stretches space along particular directions. In simpler terms, they indicate how the matrix affects the magnitude of vectors in different directions.

To find the eigenvalues of a square matrix A, you solve the characteristic equation:

det(A - λI) = 0

Where:
- det(A - λI) is the determinant of the matrix A minus λ times the identity matrix I.
- λ (lambda) represents the eigenvalue you want to find.

Solving this equation for λ will give you the eigenvalues of the matrix. Each eigenvalue corresponds to a specific eigenvector.

**Eigenvectors:**
Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that, when multiplied by a square matrix, result in a scaled version of themselves. In other words, an eigenvector v and its corresponding eigenvalue λ satisfy the equation:

Av = λv

Where:
- A is the square matrix.
- v is the eigenvector.
- λ (lambda) is the corresponding eigenvalue.

Eigenvectors tell us the directions in which the matrix only scales vectors without changing their direction. They are often normalized to have a length of 1 for convenience.

**Example:**

Let's take a simple 2x2 matrix as an example:

A = | 2  1 |
    | 1  3 |

1. Calculate Eigenvalues:
To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation:

det(A - λI) = 0

For our matrix A:

| 2-λ  1   |
| 1    3-λ |

The determinant of A - λI is:

det(A - λI) = (2-λ)(3-λ) - 1 = λ^2 - 5λ + 5

Now, we set this equation equal to zero and solve for λ:

λ^2 - 5λ + 5 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we find the eigenvalues:

λ = (5 ± √5) / 2

So, the eigenvalues for matrix A are (5 + √5)/2 and (5 - √5)/2.

2. Calculate Eigenvectors:
To find the eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue, we plug each eigenvalue back into the equation Av = λv and solve for v.

For λ = (5 + √5)/2:
(2-λ)v1 + v2 = 0
v1 + (3-λ)v2 = 0

Substituting the value of λ, we get a system of equations:

(2 - (5 + √5)/2)v1 + v2 = 0
v1 + (3 - (5 + √5)/2)v2 = 0

Solving this system will yield the eigenvector for this eigenvalue. Similarly, you can find the eigenvector for λ = (5 - √5)/2.

Eigenvectors for a matrix depend on its eigenvalues and are unique up to scaling (i.e., you can multiply an eigenvector by a constant, and it's still an eigenvector).
